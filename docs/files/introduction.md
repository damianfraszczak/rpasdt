# RP&SDT

RP&SDT - Rumour propagation and source detection toolkit.

## Overview

RP&SDT (Rumour Rumour Propoagation and Source Detection Toolkit) is a tool that allows users to prepare and configure an initial network topology, a propagation process and utilize the well-known source identification algorithms to estimate real sources based on the given diffusion graph.

The toolkit is designed to work in a window-based approach to display all performed analyses at the same time and can be used in other domains like identifying the influential nodes, simulating the propagation of the epidemics in a society, or planning a marketing campaign to obtain the best results.
